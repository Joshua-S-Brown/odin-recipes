    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blackout cake is a moist and tender cake with deep cocoa flavor.
        Layers of chocolate cake are filled with light and airy chocolate pudding,
        then all of this goodness is enrobed in a rich chocolate ganache.
        This is a dream dessert: chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>For the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with
            cooking spray; line bottoms of each cake pan with parchment paper, and spray parchment lightly with cooking
            spray. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until no
            lumps remain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk
            attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low, and gradually
            beat in flour mixture until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed.
            With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in hot coffee, beating until just incorporated, about 1 minute.
            Divide batter evenly among the prepared cake pans, about 2 cups each.
        </li>

    </ol>
